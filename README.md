CatchUp
=======

This is a fork of hzsweers/CatchUp for the purpose of measuring and improving Kotlin build performance. This was forked from git revision 66adb94 of the original project. The Kotlin version was then updated to 1.3.0-rc-146, Android Gradle plugin updated to 3.3.0-alpha16, and I made miscellaneous hacks to make the project buildable. The point of this is to compare build performance of this project with git revision 48a418d when it was purely Java.
